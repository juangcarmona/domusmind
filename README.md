# DomusMind

**DomusMind** is an open project to reduce the invisible mental load of managing a household.

Families coordinate a huge number of things every day: schedules, responsibilities, tasks, routines, children, pets, events, logistics, and planning. Most of this coordination is informal, fragmented, and cognitively expensive.

DomusMind aims to make the **operating system of a household explicit**.

---

## The Idea

A home is a **system of responsibilities, time, and coordination**.

DomusMind models that system with four core domains:

- **Family** — household structure and members  
- **Responsibilities** — ownership of household domains  
- **Calendar** — events and shared time  
- **Tasks** — execution of work and routines  

The goal is simple:

> make household coordination visible, shared, and manageable.

## Project Status

Early architecture phase.

The repository currently contains:

- product vision and principles
- domain model
- bounded contexts
- architectural decisions
- vertical slice specifications
- system roadmap

Implementation is beginning.

---

## Architecture

DomusMind is designed as a **modular monolith with vertical slices**.

Key ideas:

- bounded contexts
- explicit aggregates
- command/query separation
- REST API
- EF Core with projection-based queries
- append-only domain event log

The system is intentionally simple and evolvable.

## Goals

DomusMind is trying to achieve three things:

1. **Reduce mental load** in household coordination
2. **Make responsibilities explicit**
3. **Create a shared operational view of family life**
