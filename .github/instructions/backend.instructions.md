# Backend Instructions

## Architecture

Follow the existing layered structure:
- Domain: business rules only
- Application: commands, queries, handlers
- Contracts: request/response DTOs
- Infrastructure: persistence, auth, integrations
- API: controllers

Do not move logic across layers.

## Rules

- controllers are thin (no business logic)
- one handler = one responsibility
- do not introduce generic repositories
- do not introduce broad service/helper classes
- do not expose domain entities through API contracts

## Size and structure

- file target: <300 lines
- class target: focused, single purpose
- method target: small and readable

Split code when it mixes responsibilities.

## Changes

- prefer modifying existing slices over creating new ones
- follow existing naming and folder conventions
- add or update tests when behavior changes

## Testing

- use xUnit for tests
- use NSubstitute for mocking
- mock only external dependencies (repositories, services, infrastructure)
- do not mock domain logic or value objects
- prefer testing real handlers and domain behavior over over-mocking
- keep tests small, focused, and readable
- name tests by behavior, not implementation, e.g. `Handle_WhenCondition_ShouldResult`
- add or update tests when behavior changes
- use AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure in tests

## Completion gate

Never report a backend task as done without:
1. Running `dotnet build` and confirming it succeeds (0 errors)
2. Running `dotnet test` and confirming all tests pass
3. If existing tests fail due to the change, fix them before proceeding
4. If new behavior was added, add a test for it
