# DomusMind — C4 Component Diagram (Domain)

## Purpose

This document shows the internal component structure of the **"Domain"** container.

The domain layer contains the core business model of DomusMind.  
It defines aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain events.

V1 is built around four core bounded contexts:

- "Family"
- "Responsibilities"
- "Calendar"
- "Tasks"

These modules represent the operational backbone of the household system.

---

## Domain Modules

### "Family"

Defines the household identity structure.

Owns:

- "Family" aggregate
- "Member"
- "Dependent"
- "Pet"
- "Relationship"

Responsibilities:

- household structure
- membership lifecycle
- family identity

Other contexts reference members but cannot modify them.

---

### "Responsibilities"

Defines accountability across the household.

Owns:

- "ResponsibilityDomain" aggregate
- ownership assignments
- participation roles

Responsibilities:

- primary ownership
- secondary ownership
- responsibility distribution

---

### "Calendar"

Defines the temporal structure of family life.

Owns:

- "Event" aggregate
- schedules
- participants
- reminders

Responsibilities:

- scheduling
- time coordination
- timeline construction

---

### "Tasks"

Defines operational execution.

Owns:

- "Task" aggregate
- "Routine" aggregate
- task lifecycle

Responsibilities:

- work execution
- recurring routines
- task completion tracking

---

### "Shared Domain Elements"

Shared concepts used across modules.

Includes:

- domain events
- strongly typed identifiers
- value object primitives

These elements are shared but must remain minimal to avoid coupling.

    Component(shared, "Shared Domain Elements", ".NET", "IDs, value objects, domain events")

}

Rel(responsibilities, family, "References MemberId")
Rel(calendar, family, "References participants")
Rel(tasks, family, "Assigns tasks to members")

Rel(tasks, calendar, "Creates tasks from events")
Rel(tasks, responsibilities, "Categorizes tasks")

Rel(calendar, shared, "Uses domain events and value objects")
Rel(tasks, shared, "Uses domain events and value objects")
Rel(responsibilities, shared, "Uses domain events and value objects")
Rel(family, shared, "Uses domain events and value objects")
```

## Notes

The domain layer is the **core of DomusMind**.

Rules:

* domain modules must remain independent
* cross-module interaction occurs through domain events
* modules reference identity by ID only
* no module may modify another module’s aggregate

This structure preserves strong boundaries while keeping the system deployable as a modular monolith.
