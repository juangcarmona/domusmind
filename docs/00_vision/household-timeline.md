# Household Timeline

The Household Timeline is the primary interface of DomusMind.

It represents the **current operational state of the household across time**.

It is the primary operational surface for the product, including the Today and Home experience.

Instead of separate systems for calendars, tasks, reminders, and responsibilities, DomusMind converges household activity into one continuous timeline. 

The timeline answers one question:

> What matters today for this household?

This screen becomes the **default entry point** of the system.

# Concept

A household constantly coordinates:

* people
* time
* responsibilities
* plans

DomusMind expresses this coordination as a **timeline of household activity**.

Anything that affects the household appears in this timeline.

Examples include:

* plans
* chores
* tasks
* reminders

Users should never need to open separate tools to understand what is happening.

Planning remains the write-heavy management surface where households organize future work, but the timeline remains the place where the current household state becomes immediately legible.

# Timeline Entries

The timeline is composed of **entries**.

An entry represents something that matters at a specific moment or day.

Entries may originate from different household systems.

Common examples:

### Plan

A scheduled activity involving one or more people.

Example:

```
Mateo football practice
Friday 18:00
```

---

### Chore

A recurring responsibility assigned to someone.

Example:

```
Trash → Juan
Today
```

---

### Task

A one-time activity that needs completion.

Example:

```
Buy milk
```

---

### Reminder

A prompt to bring attention to something important.

Example:

```
Water the plants
```

These types are **not separate applications**.

They are simply different kinds of entries within the same timeline.

---

# Today View

The default DomusMind screen is the **Today view**.

It shows everything that requires attention today.

Example:

```
Today

09:00
Lucía dentist appointment

18:00
Mateo football practice

Trash → Juan
Laundry → Lucía

Buy milk
```

A household member should understand the situation **within seconds**.

The system should immediately answer:

* what is happening
* who is responsible
* what needs attention

If a plan or task is associated with an Area, that accountability context may be shown here. Area assignment remains optional.

---

# Upcoming Days

The timeline extends naturally into the near future.

Example:

```
Tomorrow

Dishwasher → Juan
School meeting → Lucía
```

This allows the household to anticipate upcoming obligations.

Planning becomes visible without needing to navigate multiple tools.

---

# Shared Household Awareness

The timeline provides **shared situational awareness** for the household.

Anyone can quickly see:

* what is happening today
* who is responsible for what
* what requires attention
* what is coming soon

Areas support this shared awareness, but they are not the primary screen. They provide lightweight household structure rather than a separate dashboard or reporting module.

This replaces informal coordination mechanisms such as:

* group chat reminders
* notes on the fridge
* verbal coordination

---

# Conflict Awareness

Households frequently encounter conflicts between plans and responsibilities.

DomusMind surfaces these situations directly in the timeline.

Example:

```
Juan assigned to Trash
Juan has a meeting at the same time
```

The system can suggest simple adjustments:

```
Move Trash to Saturday?
```

The goal is **quick household decisions**, not manual schedule management.

---

# Why the Timeline Exists

Without a timeline, households rely on disconnected systems:

```
Calendar
Task lists
Reminders
Responsibility trackers
```

Each system requires separate attention.

The timeline unifies them into **one continuous household flow**.

Even when Areas are used sparsely, the timeline should still provide a complete operational picture in V1.

---

# Design Goal

DomusMind should feel like a **smart household board**.

The timeline replaces:

* sticky notes
* group chat reminders
* mental task lists

The system provides a clear shared understanding of household activity.

---

# Core Principle

The most important concept in DomusMind is not:

```
Family
Member
Task
Event
```

The most important concept is:

```
Today
```

Everything in DomusMind ultimately answers:

> What matters today for this household?
