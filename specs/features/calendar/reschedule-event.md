## Preconditions

- event must not be cancelled
- if provided, `newEndTime` must be after `newStartTime`
- command modifies only the `Event` aggregate

## State Changes

On success, the system updates the event schedule.

Participants and other event properties remain unchanged.

## Invariants

- event must belong to the same family
- schedule must remain valid

- `EventRescheduled`

## Success Result

## Notes
