# Spec — Transfer Responsibility

## Purpose

Transfer primary ownership of a responsibility domain to another member.

This operation makes accountability changes explicit and traceable.

In product surfaces, this may appear as transferring Area ownership, while the domain command remains `TransferResponsibility`.

## Context

- Module: Responsibilities
- Aggregate: `ResponsibilityDomain`
- Slice: `transfer-responsibility`
- Command: `TransferResponsibility`

## Inputs

Required:

- `responsibilityDomainId`
- `newPrimaryOwnerId`

Optional:

- `effectiveDate`
- `reason`

## Preconditions

- responsibility domain must exist
- new primary owner must exist in the same family
- command modifies only the `ResponsibilityDomain` aggregate

## State Changes

On success, the previous primary owner is replaced by the new one.

The domain remains active and owned.

The transfer updates accountability for the domain. It does not directly reassign execution of existing plans or tasks.

## Invariants

- a domain may have only one primary owner
- the new owner must belong to the same family
- ownership transfer must preserve a valid owned state

## Events

Emit:

- `ResponsibilityTransferred`

## Success Result

Return:

- `responsibilityDomainId`
- `newPrimaryOwnerId`
- `status = transferred`

## Failure Cases

- responsibility domain not found
- member not found
- invalid transfer

## Notes

Transfer is explicit domain behavior, not an implicit overwrite.

This keeps accountability changes auditable while allowing product surfaces to use simpler household language around Areas and Owners.
